# DID Solution With IOTA

## Introduction

### Background

For example, the collaboration between BMW, Volkswagen, and Nissan in developing autonomous driving maps exemplifies the concept of "coopetition" â€” a blend of cooperation and competition. These automakers aim to accelerate technological development to enhance their competitive edge and raise industry entry barriers. To facilitate the sharing and development of new knowledge and technologies, they need to interlink their information systems to access shared resources.

### Issues

Traditionally, such interlinking relies on a new entity, perhaps a jointly established access control node by the three companies, which in turn determines the trust and security of the entire information system.

From a trust perspective, since these companies are competitors, any party manipulating this nodeâ€”such as through authorization abuse or data interception â€” would collapse the trust chain. From a security standpoint, attacks on this node, whether by other competitors or malicious entities, such as denial-of-service attacks or hacking, would pose significant information security risks to all three companies.

### Solution

Therefore, a decentralized and trustworthy identity authentication framework is needed to address the issue of interlinking information systems. The IOTA Identity Framework offers a solution that combines these characteristics with low cost and high efficiency.

## Folder Structure
